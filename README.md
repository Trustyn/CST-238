#**Description**
Space Shooter is a top down shooter similar to Asteroids.  A constant barrage of meteorites and enemy spaceships are randomly spawned with the sole mission of annihilating the player.

#**Technologies**
We will be using the Unity tutorial Space Shooter(From the Unity Learn Turorial set) as a base and extending the capabilities to conform to the standards of the class

#**Inspiration for Project**
**Chad Greene** - I am mostly interested in learing more about the Unity environment and what it has to offer.  I have a few projects in mind that I would like to develop using it.  At the moment I am most interested in android environment but would also like to see how the cross platform builds work.
<br>
**Branden Alder** - I am extreamly interested in learning the GUI aspect of programing and have dabbled into the QT world for my junior project, by doing so I was honestly not that big a fan which we then switched to Android Studio. But for a program like Unity it's almost like pure creation and the dabling I have done so far has definetly sparked interest. 

#**Bugs and TODO list**
1. Add splash screens for Entry, Exit and GameOver
1. Add Power up collectors for player
1. Add new levels
1. Add new gun upgrades and weapons fire
1. Allow AI more flexability
1. Add thumb controls for android
